# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains coding projects and assignments completed during my JavaScript course. Here, you will find various examples and exercises that demonstrate my learning and coding skills.

Each project will showcase different aspects of JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and more. I will regularly push code to this repository to track my progress and to share my work for review.

Please feel free to explore the projects and provide any feedback!
